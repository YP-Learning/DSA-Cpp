# R-2.11
Consider the inheritance of classes from Exercise R-2.6, and let d be an
object variable of type Horse. If d refers to an actual object of type 
Equestrian, can it be cast to the class Racer? Why or why no

No, it cannot be cast to Racer, even though both classes inherit from 
Horse, they are not related to each other, hence not allowing the types 
to cast into each other, both having different properties.
